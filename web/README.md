# Abrechnung Web

This is the web frontend for abrechnung, written in React and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

## Setup

```
yarn install
```


## Running

### Developing

Run in development mode:

```
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console!
How awesome is that?


### Testing

```
yarn test
```

Launches the [test runner](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) in the interactive watch mode.


### Production build

```
yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles the abrechnung in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready [to be deployed](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)!


### Eject the build

```
yarn eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
